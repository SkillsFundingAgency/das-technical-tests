# Coding Exercise

Spend no more than 35 minutes on this exercise.

> Complete your implementation by cloning this repository on GitHub and submitting it back to us as a zip file, remember to include your randomly generated input.data file.

## Part 1
Complete the Multiply method that can be found in the SFA.DAS.Technical.Test.Infrastructure.Math class so that it multiplies two positive integers together without using the multiplication operator

```
For Example:
Given the two integers 6 and 3 the product would be 18
```

## Part 2
Given an array containing an even number of integers, multiply each adjacent pair together using the Multiply method from part 1 then take the product of each multiplication and add them together to give a result. The data for this part of the task will be randomly generated for you.

```
For Example:
Given the array [6,3,2,10]
Multiply 6 by 3 giving 18
Multiply 2 by 10 giving 20
Add 18 and 20 giving the answer 38
```

## Part 3
Complete the unit tests for the Multiply method that can be found in the SFA.DAS.Technical.Test.Tests.MathTests class and add any further tests you feel may be missing
